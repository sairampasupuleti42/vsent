                        <p><img src="images/about/about-seven.jpg" alt="Slider Image" class="alignleft img-thumbnail">I  have been an active Congress member since 1980  from  my student days.
                            By virtue of my keen interest in politics, I  worked as city youth congress leader at first and became the City Youth Congress secretary in 1985 and was nominated as general secretary in 1989.
                        </p>
                        <p> Later I worked as secretary of  City Congress Committee (CCC) in 1990.  worked as APCC publicity division general secretary to the committee headed by late Dasari Narayana Rao during 1999 elections. Afterwards I acted as the District Returning Officer (DRO) in the Congress party organizational elections held in Tamil Nadu. </p>
                        <p><img src="images/about/about-_main_3.JPG" alt="Slider Image" class="alignright img-thumbnail">From 2000 to 2004, I was nominated as general secretary, APCC ,BC cell under the leadership of Pitla Krishna and Mukesh Kumar Goud and played an important role in mobilizing BCs into the Congress fold. I led an agitation to protect Krishna Delta as  convenor of the Krishna Delta Parirakshana Samithi and successfully rallied the Krishna delta farmers behind the Congress Party.

                        <p>I made herculean efforts to bring popular Social activist and Narmada Bachao Andolan fame  Medha patkar to Vijayawada to highlight the pitiful plight of farmers whose lands were unilaterally acquired on a massive scale by the Telugu Desam Party government in the name of construction of the capital city in and around Amaravathi  for the Newly born  Andhra Pradesh State<br> <br></p>
                        <p><img src="images/about/Image0065.JPG" alt="Slider Image" class="alignleft img-thumbnail">And as s a true congress worker, I was arrested on many occasions by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)  government in 1995 and 2004 for opposing the anti government policies implemented by the government.</p>
                        <p> At present I am working with our senior congress leaders under the able leadership of Indian National Congress president and Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Mrs Sonia Gandhi who was ranked as one of the few influential persons on the globe.   Further I am maintaining healthy relationship with Congress leaders and cadre too. </p>

                            For the last over 35 years from 1983 to 2014 I had put in strenuous efforts to make the Congress candidates victorious in 7 Lok Sabah, and 8 Assembly elections

                        </p>
                        <p>I also worked hard for the success of the congress candidates in the local body elections in Krishna district.</p>
                        <p>My life’s ambition is to serve the party in particular and people in general.</p>

                        <p>I was successful in organizing many large scale programmes for strengthening Congress Party from grassroots level in Vijayawada and other parts of Krishna district with the help of Rajya Sabha MP KVP Ramachandra Rao when  Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy was chief minister of the Composite Andhra Pradesh state.I was successful in organizing many large scale programmes for strengthening Congress Party from grassroots level in Vijayawada and other parts of Krishna district with the help of Rajya Sabha MP KVP Ramachandra Rao when  Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy was chief minister of the Composite Andhra Pradesh state.<br> <br></p>
                        <p><img src="images/about/Image0098.JPG" alt="Slider Image" class="alignleft img-thumbnail">I was first to give timely rejoinders to the false allegations often made by the Telugu Desam Party against the Congress Party then in power. I could win the blessings of  the former chief minister who was popularly known as YSR, for playing an active role in taking various welfare and development programmes right into the hearts of the people.</p>
                        <p> During 2005–2006, when a group was opposing construction of the YSR dream project Polavaram which could irrigate huge areas of agricultural land to boost yield , I made strenuous efforts to create awareness among people on the indisputable need of the project.</p>
                        <p><img src="images/about/01.jpg" alt="Slider Image" class="alignright img-thumbnail"> I was instrumental in mobilizing the support of farmers with the help  of the former congress leader and ZP chairman Pinnamaneni Koteswararao, Rytu Sangham leader Kolli Nageswararao (CPI) and  the then Congress MLA Mandali Buddhaprasad and stood by the Congress party. These things are well known to people. I conducted many programmes to amplify  the inaudible voices of the BCs, women, farmers and the suppressed people to safeguard their rights and thus won their favor.
                        </p>
                        <p> After the demise of our great leader Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy, I emphasized the need for construction of a flyover at Goddess Kanakadurga temple in Vijayawada to facilitate unhindered flow of traffic. Vijayawadians and the media persons are well aware of the key role played by me in sensitizing the people and the government on the indispensable need of the fly over in spite of strong opposition from the then local member of parliament and some other leaders. </p>
                        <p>It was me who played a significant role in securing sanction of the flyover by using the good offices of the then union surface transport minister Kamalnath.</p>

                        <p>I would like to tell you that in my over three and half decades of public life I  extended my dedicated services to people  as leader of students, youth congress, Congress , BCs and  farmers at City, District and State levels and continuing to do so. .<br> <br></p>
                        <p><img src="images/about/about_main_33.jpeg" alt="Slider Image" class="alignleft img-thumbnail">In pursuance to the desire of the late leader, I extended my full support to Samaikyandhra (Integrated Andhra Pradesh) movement in the back drop of the state bifurcation. I also took active steps to form a political JAC by bringing together the Congress, TDP and other political parties. I was the first convenor to the JAC. By the way, I also chaired the first meeting in Vijayawada Press Club for chalking out an action plan for Samaikyandhra movement which is comparable to the spirit of the Freedom struggle.</p>
